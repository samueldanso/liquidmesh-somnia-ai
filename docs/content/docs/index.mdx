# LiquidMesh Finance

**The AI orchestration layer for concentrated liquidity on Somnia.**

LiquidMesh is a **decentralized, non-custodial autonomous liquidity orchestration protocol** built on Somnia powered by a multi-agent orchestration framework. It enables liquidity providers (LPs) to achieve maximum capital efficiency and superior risk-adjusted yield by autonomously reasoning, executing, and managing liquidity positions across Somnia DEXes.
