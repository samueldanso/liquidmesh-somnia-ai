## Problem

Liquidity provision on Somnia DEXes is manual and fragmented. LPs must monitor pools and rebalance constantly; most liquidity remains idle or misplaced during market changes.

## Solution

LiquidMesh uses a multi‑agent orchestration framework to autonomously manage concentrated liquidity. Three agents — Watcher, Strategist, Executor — coordinate under the AgentMesh Orchestrator to monitor pools, reason about market conditions, and execute optimized strategies on-chain.
